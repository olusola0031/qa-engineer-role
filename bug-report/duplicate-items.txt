Bug Report: Duplicate Todo Items Appear after Quickly Adding Tasks

Summary:
A user reported an issue where rapidly adding multiple todos sometimes results in duplicate items appearing. Deleting one instance of the todo can also cause multiple instances to disappear unexpectedly.

User Steps:
1. Type a todo like "Buy groceries."
2. Press Enter quickly multiple times (within the same second).
3. Notice the same todo appears more than once.
4. Try deleting one of them; sometimes multiple entries vanish.

Expected Behavior:
- Each todo should be unique, even when entered quickly.
- Deleting a single todo should only remove the selected todo.

Additional Notes:
- This may be related to ID assignment or uniqueness checks.
